#summary baseflight configuration parameters available by 'set'
#labels baseflight,cli,config

NOTE: These settings always describe LATEST firmware available in SVN, and do not necessarily reflect features of pre-built firmware images.

= Introduction =

There are 2 groups of settings. One is the "global" setting, generally affecting things like hardware, receiver, ESC outputs, etc and "profile" setting, which can be different between 3 profiles, affecting things like PID, deadbands, servo limits, etc.

= Global settings =

|| looptime || This is the main loop time (in us). Changing this affects PID effect. Default of 3500us/285Hz should work  for everyone. Setting it to zero does not limit loop time, so it will go as fast as possible (about 750us/1.3kHz) in latest builds. ||
|| midrc || This is an important number to set in order to avoid trimming receiver/transmitter. Most standard receivers will have this at 1500, however Futaba transmitters will need this set to 1520. A way to find out if this needs to be changed, is to clear all trim/subtrim on transmitter, and connect to GUI. Note the value most channels idle at - this should be the number to choose. Once midrc is set, use subtrim on transmitter to make sure all channels (except throttle of course) are centered at midrc value. ||
|| rssi_aux_channel || read PWM (1000..2000us) RSSI value from a given AUX channel. This is used for OSD when transmitting baseflight internal RSSI value. ||
|| minthrottle and maxthrottle || These are min/max values (in us) that are sent to esc when armed. Defaults of 1150/1850 are OK for everyone, for use with AfroESC, they could be set to 1064/1864. ||
|| mincheck and maxcheck || These are min/max values (in us) which, when a channel is smaller (min) or larger (max) than the value will activate various RC commands, such as arming, or stick configuration. Normally, every RC channel should be set so that min = 1000us, max = 2000us. On most transmitters this usually means 125% endpoints. Default check values are 100us above/below this value. ||
|| motor_pwm_rate and servo_pwm_rate || Output frequency (in Hz) for motor and servo pins. Defaults are 400Hz for motor, and 50Hz for servo. When using tricopters w/digital servo, this rate can be increased. Max of 498Hz (for 500Hz pwm period), and min of 50Hz. ||
|| mincommand || This is the PWM value sent to ESCs when they are not armed. If ESCs beep slowly when powered up, try decreasing this value. It can also be used for calibrating all ESCs at once. ||
|| retarded_arm || Disabled by default, enabling (setting to 1) allows disarming by throttle low + roll. This could be useful for non-acro tricopters, where default arming by yaw could move tail servo too much. ||
|| serial_baudrate || This is the baud rate used for main serial interface - default of 115200 is probably best to leave alone. Can be changed if for example RF telemetry such as XBee is used which is limited to 57600 baud. ||
|| gps_baudrate || This is the baud rate at which GPS will run. For NMEA-type GPS (gps_type=0) this can be -1 to attempt to auto-detect baudrate. For UBLOX and MTK, firmware will attempt to configure GPS at the provided speed. Other allowed values are, 0: 115200, 1: 57600, 2: 38400, 3: 19200, 4: 9600 (not recommended) baud. ||
|| serialrx_type || When feature SERIALRX is enabled, this allows connection of Spektrum or SBUS-compatible serial receiver. Currently supported values are 0 for Spektrum 10bit (1024) mode, 1 for Spektrum 11bit (2048) mode, 2 for Futaba SBUS mode, 3 for Graupner SUMD. Note, that SBUS will require a hardware inverter in order to connect. ||
|| vbatscale || result is Vbatt in 0.1V steps. 3.3V = ADC Vref, 4095 = 12bit adc, 110 = 11:1 voltage divider (10k:1k) x 10 for 0.1V. Adjust this slightly if reported pack voltage is different from multimeter reading. You can get current voltage by typing "status" in cli. ||
|| vbatmaxcellvoltage || maximum voltage per cell, used for auto-detecting battery voltage in 0.1V units, default is 43 (4.3V) ||
|| vbatmincellvoltage || minimum voltage per cell, this triggers battery out alarms, in 0.1V units, default is 33 (3.3V) ||
|| align_gyro, align_acc, align_mag || When running baseflight on non-default hardware or adding support for new sensors/sensor boards, these values are used for sensor orientation. Default of zero means the driver determines alignment (and this generally means it's configured for baseflight standard hardware). Default orientation of X forward, Y right, Z up is 1. After that, the numbers are as follows, and mean sensor is rotated. CW0_DEG=1, CW90_DEG=2, CW180_DEG=3, CW270_DEG=4, CW0_DEG_FLIP=5, CW90_DEG_FLIP=6, CW180_DEG_FLIP=7, CW270_DEG_FLIP=8. This should cover all orientations. When carefully understood, these values can also be used to rotate (in 90deg steps) or flip the board. ||
|| board_align_roll, board_align_pitch, board_align_yaw || Arbitrary board rotation in degrees, to allow mounting it sideways / upside down / rotated etc ||
|| acc_hardware || This is used to suggest which accelerometer driver should load, or to force no accelerometer in case gyro-only flight is needed. Default (0) will attempt to auto-detect among enabled drivers. Otherwise, to force a particular device, set it to 1 for ADXL345, 2 for MPU6050 integrated accelerometer, 3 for MMA8452, 4 for BMA280, or 5 to disable accelerometer alltogether - resulting in gyro-only operation. ||
|| moron_threshold || When powering up, gyro bias is calculated. If the model is shaking/moving during this initial calibration, offsets are calculated incorrectly, and could lead to poor flying performance. This threshold (default of 32) means how much average gyro reading could differ before re-calibration is triggered. ||
|| gyro_lpf || Hardware lowpass filter for gyro. Allowed values depend on the driver - For example MPU6050 allows 5,10,20,42,98,188,256Hz, while MPU3050 doesn't allow 5Hz. If you have to set gyro lpf below 42Hz generally means the frame is vibrating too much, and that should be fixed first. Values outside of supported range will usually be ignored by drivers, and will configure lpf to default value of 42Hz. ||
|| gps_type || When feature GPS is enabled, configures type of connected GPS. NMEA=0, UBLOX=1, MTK(NMEA)=2, MTK(Binary)=3 ||

= Per-profile settings =

|| pid_controller || default (0) multiwii PID controller, 1 = alternative PID controller. ||
|| deadband and yawdeadband || These are values (in us) by how much RC input can be different before it's considered valid. For transmitters with jitter on outputs, this value can be increased. Defaults are zero, but can be increased up to 10 or so if rc inputs twitch while idle. ||
|| mag_declination || Current location magnetic declination in {{{[sign]dddmm}}} format. For example, -6deg 37min, = {{{-637}}} for Japan. Leading zero in ddd not required. Get your local magnetic declination here: http://magnetic-declination.com/ ||
|| gimbal_flags || When feature SERVO_TILT is enabled, this can be a combination of the following numbers: 1=normal gimbal (default), 2=tiltmix gimbal, 4=in PPM (or SERIALRX) input mode, this will forward AUX1..4 RC inputs to PWM5..8 pins ||
|| tri_unarmed_servo || on tricopter mix only, if this is set to 1, servo will always be correcting regardless of armed state. to disable this, set it to 0. ||
